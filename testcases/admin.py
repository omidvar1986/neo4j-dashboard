# MongoDB models don't work with Django admin
# If you need admin interface, consider using mongoengine admin or a custom admin interface

# from django.contrib import admin
# from .models import TestCase, TestStep, Section

# Note: mongoengine models cannot be registered with Django admin
# You can create a custom admin interface if needed
